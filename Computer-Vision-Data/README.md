# Computer-Vision Files

This is the repository for work that I'm doing with lots of images for an upcoming workshop on computer vision and the past. Hopefully it's somewhat useful. Code will be added as it comes together.

## Current Files

**Image-Extract-Ca.sh**: Decently commented, but it contains a regular expression to find all files within a top-level domain (currently. ca) based on popular file formats partially drawn from this [article](http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1714). It takes them, sequentially numbers them, and dumps them in an output directory.  I have more versions that do different TLDs or structures, but you can probably imagine how to do that. 

**Image-File-Formats-in-Ca.md**: Poorly named file, it's where I'm dumping ongoing results of what file formats are where. It gives me something to do while my computer works.

It is currently being run on *fully decompressed* WARC files.

## Questions/Comments/Etc.?

Let me know!
