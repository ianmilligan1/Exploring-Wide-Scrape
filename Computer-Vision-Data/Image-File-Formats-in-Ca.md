Here are frequency of image formats found so far. This is just really quickly copied over, so there may be problems here. Again, it's a tranche drawn from the 80TB Wide Web Scrape. 

I will update when the .cn is done processing, and will also provide info on all the other datasets. Plus links to details on what exactly this dataset is. [You can find some information here on my blog.](http://ianmilligan.ca/tag/web-archives/)
