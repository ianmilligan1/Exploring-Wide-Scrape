# Postal Codes in the .ca Top Level Domain

This is a repository for some data generated by extracting postcards from the sample of the 80TB World Wide Web extracted by Ian Milligan. Some details are available [here](http://ianmilligan.ca/2013/06/17/finding-ca-domains-in-the-80tb-wide-crawl/) and [here](http://ianmilligan.ca/2013/06/24/finding-specific-websites-and-creating-full-text-indexes-using-warc-tools/). A major overview of some of my work can be found in this [slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/IanMilligan1/international-internet-preservation-consortium-research-slides-from-ian-milligan). 

This dataset supports the blog post ["Extracting and Visualizing Postal codes in the .ca TLD"](http://ianmilligan.ca/2014/06/19/extracting-and-visualizing-postal-codes-in-the-ca-tld/).

### What's in this repository?

There are five files, presented in the order of my research process.

**postalcodes-normalized.csv**: This is a list of all postal codes, normalized into the format A1A1A1, extracted from the .ca top-level domain sample that I'm playing with. It was extracted using the regular expression `[ABCEGHJKLMNPRSTVXY]{1}\d{1}[A-Z]{1} *\d{1}[A-Z]{1}\d{1}`.

**postalcodes-sorted-by-frequency.csv**: This is that list sorted by frequency. 

**postalcode-alldata-location-frequency.csv**: Post GeoCoder, this is the data generated with frequency.

**postalcodes-lat-long-by-frequency.csv**: If you want to dump the data into a GIS program or other form of visualization, this is *just* the lat-long data with frequency.

**CA-TLD-Postalcode-Visualizations.bmp**: A fairly high resolution output, for example purposes.

### Any Questions?

Let me know. Always happy to chat.
